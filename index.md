Hello! I am a PhD Candidate in Economics at the University of Groningen.

My research is focused (broadly) on political and development economics, using historical data to ask (hopefully) interesting questions.

## Working papers
"Resisting reform in the public sector: theory and historical evidence from the UK"

"Regional Identity in Organisations: Evidence from the Western Front of WWI"

## Work in progress
"Did pandemics cause mistrust during colonialism? Evidence from annual vaccination records in Colonial India"

Building local institutions in colonial Nigeria

The consequences of colonial vaccination in India
